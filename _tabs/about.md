A personal blog about life, art, tech and big ideas.

My name is **JGenneX** (pronounced *Jay-Jen-Necks*). I write about ideas that have been brewing at the back of my mind, most of which I never took the time to fully flesh out until now. In my quest to make sense of this mysterious existence called life, my insatiable curiosity has led me down countless rabbit holes. Sometimes, these excursions lead me to weird and wonderful places; other times, they lead me down baffling dead ends. Wherever these adventures take me, I always return to the three things that inspire me the most, namely **literature**, **technology** and **anthropology**.

So whether you are a lost soul in search of meaning, or an enlightened sage just short of attaining nirvana, I hope youâ€™ll spare some time to sit down and have a chat with me. We have much to discuss!
